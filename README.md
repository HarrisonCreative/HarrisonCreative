Hi, I’m @HarrisonCreative!
I’m interested in computer science and graphic design.
I’m currently learning computer science.
I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects for experience.

Fun fact: In high school, I scored perfect in normal and AP computer science, except for one quiz question where I forgot a curley bracket.
